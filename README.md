## Welcome!

The internship will have three phases, lasting 1, 2 , and 2 weeks, respectively.
In the first phase, you will work in small groups on basic computing skills with a mentor.
In the second phase, you will work through a structured course to learn data science.
In the third  phase, you will work in teams on a real data science project. The third phase is entirely online.

Because part of the internship is online, it is very important for you to become familiar with the technologies we will be using to stay connected:

### Schedule

Your schedule for the first three weeks will be very similar every day.
We'll have a morning session, lunch with a speaker, and an afternoon session.

In phase 3 (online), you'll have Tuesday lunch on Zoom with a faculty member or data science professional (online), as well as some afternoon presentations on ethics and giving presentations.
The phase 3 schedule is more flexible because the daily activities will otherwise be set by your project mentors.

Remember you can always ask questions in Discord if you're not sure what to do or if something isn't working.
