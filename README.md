## Welcome!

The internship will have two phases, lasting 6 weeks and 2 weeks, respectively.
In the first phase, you will work through a loosely structured course to learn data science.
In the second phase, you will work in teams on a real data science project.

Because the internship is online, it is very important for you to become familiar with the technologies we will be using to stay connected:

### Schedule

Your schedule for the first six weeks will be very similar every day.
The only major differences are Tuesdays, when you will have lunch with a faculty member (online) and Thursdays, when we will have a presentation.
