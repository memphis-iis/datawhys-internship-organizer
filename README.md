## Welcome!

The internship will have three phases, lasting 2, 4 , and 2 weeks, respectively.
In the first phase, you will work in small groups on basic computing skills with a mentor.
In the second phase, you will work through a loosely structured course to learn data science.
In the third  phase, you will work in teams on a real data science project.

Because the internship is online, it is very important for you to become familiar with the technologies we will be using to stay connected:

### Schedule

Your schedule for the first two weeks will be very similar every day.
The only major differences are Tuesdays, when you will have lunch with a faculty member or data science professional (online).

When phase 2 starts, the schedule will change so there more sessions in the afternoon. Additionally, we will have a presentation on Thursdays.

Phase 3 will keep the Tuesday lunches and Thursday presentations, but the daily activities will otherwise be set by your project mentors.

Remember you can always ask questions in Discord if you're not sure what to do or if something isn't working.
